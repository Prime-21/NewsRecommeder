iPrint is an upcoming media house in India that offers media and information services to the people. The companyâ€™s business extends across a wide range of media, including news and information services on sports, weather, education, health, research, stocks and healthcare. Over the years, through its online application, iPrint has been efficiently delivering news and information to the common people.  However, with time and technological advancements, several new competitors of iPrint have emerged in the market. Hence, it has decided to begin providing a more personalised experience to its customers.

 

Till date, iPrint was managing its customer base by only recommending the most popular and similar news articles to what the user has already read or watched. However, the recommended news articles were often not relevant to the majority of the users. It was not able to recommend any new content to its customers, and gradually, the company started losing such users, which eventually resulted in immense revenue loss.
